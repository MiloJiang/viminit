# viminit
=======

<b>I am currently developing this project based off my own personal workflow. I am going to release a video once a final version of the project is complete.</b>

viminit is a one line install script aimed at transitioning developers used to an IDE environment to a VIM environment with a navigation menu, fuzzy file search, syntax checking and automatic tag closing features similar to Textmate with only one command to copy and paste into your terminal and with the least amount of plugins possible (no rubygems)

## Installation


```bash
$ curl -Lo- https://raw.github.com/jeraldrich/viminit/master/viminit.sh | bash
```
